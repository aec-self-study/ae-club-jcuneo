I'm hoping to get a more formalized, best-practices education around how to do great analytics engineer work. I've learned some cool stuff on my own kinda piecemeal, but when I'm building dbt models and such, I know that I don't have the benefit of really seeing some recommended ways that this should be done. Do I have the right considerations in mind when I'm building? I want to make things that are consistently high-quality for my company and my team to use.
